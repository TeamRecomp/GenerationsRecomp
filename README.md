# Generations Recompiled
Generations Recompiled is a WIP PC Port version of Sonic Generations (Xbox 360) based on Unleashed Recompiled. The PC Version of Sonic Generations still available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/71340/Sonic_Generations_Collection/), however, this project will be available as an alternative besides [Sonic X Shadow Generations](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513280/SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS/).

**This project does not have any assets included due to legal reasons and will require a legitimate copy of Sonic Generations for Xbox 360.**
